# MultimodalMappingPDA-scRNASeq

Processed data and downstream analysis of scRNA Seq experiments for the paper Multimodal Mapping of the Tumor and Peripheral Blood Immune Landscape in Human Pancreatic Cancer. 
This repository includes the R script that will replicate Figures 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 2E, 2F, 3A, 3B, 3C, 3D, 3E, 3F, 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, 4E, 4F, 4G, 5A, 5B, 5C, 5D, 5E, 5F, 6A, 6B, 6C, 6D, 6E, 6F, 6G and Supplementary Figures S2B, S2C, S2D, S3A, S3B, S3C, S3D, S3E, S4A, S4B, S4C, S5A, S5B, S5C, S5D, S5E. The R script will also provide the code to get the values input into Prism to replicate Figure 3D and Supplementary Figure S4B.

To replicate the analysis, load the R script into R Studio and load the data into the Global Environment. Running the R script as described will generate the figures found in the manuscript.
