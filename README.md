# Human-scRNASeq-paper1

Processed data and downstream analysis of scRNA Seq experiments for the paper Multimodal Mapping of the Immune Landscape in Human Pancreatic Cancer. 

This repository includes the normalized, scaled, batch corrected, filtered data and R script that will replicate Figures 3B, 3D, 3F, 3G, 3I, 5A, 5B, 5D, 5E, 6H and Supplementary Figures 3B, 3C, 5E, 5F, 5G, 5H, 5I, 5J, 6A, 6B, 6C, 6F, 6G. The R script will also provide the code to get the values input into Prism to replicate Figures 3C, 5C, and Supplementary Figures 6D, 6E, 6H.

To replicate the analysis, load the R script into R Studio and load the data into the Global Environment. Running the R script as described will generate the figures found in the manuscript.
